## Autonomous Sanitization Robot for Healthcare

## Problem: 
   Maintaining hygiene and preventing infection spread in healthcare settings through manual disinfection is inefficient, inconsistent, and risky for healthcare workers.
  
## Solution: 
   An Arduino-based autonomous robot for contactless surface disinfection.

## Key Features:

 * Autonomous Navigation: Uses ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and movement.
 * Effective Disinfection: Employs a water pump for even disinfectant spraying.
 * Easy Maintenance: Modular, solder-free design for simple assembly and upkeep.
 * Enhanced Safety: Unique advanced flame detection sensor that proactively identifies fire or heat sources, automatically halting spraying to minimize fire risks in high-risk medical environments.
   
## Overall Benefit: 
   Provides a safe, automated, and efficient solution for consistent hygiene in healthcare, reducing human effort and exposure risks, with a critical added layer of fire safety.
